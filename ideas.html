<p>These apps could be developed and could</p>
<h3 id="free-inmate-locator-service">Free Inmate Locator Service</h3>
<p>Automatically notifies you when an inmate has been moved to a new facility by batch querying the inmate locator daily.</p>
<p>Why? Because families and friends often spend a lot of time and effort trying to track movements through the system.  This is especially difficult with political prisoners, prisoners with mental health issues, etcetera.</p>
<p>Email or sms notifications.</p>
<h3 id="web-based-letter-sending-service">Web-based letter sending service</h3>
<p>A service could be offered that would allow folks to send letters up to three pages for a dollar, using a service such as <a href="https://www.trypaper.com/">https://www.trypaper.com/</a>.</p>
<p>The APIs we have would ensure proper address information would be used, and that folks could look up a prisoner by their inmate number, name, etc and the sending address would be <em>exact</em>.  Allowing embeddable buttons and such would be great for campaign sites.</p>
<h2 id="services">Services</h2>
<h3 id="non-profit-wire-transfer-service">Non-profit wire transfer service</h3>
<p>The BOP API is used by private companies to provide wire transfer services for sending commossiary.  A little investigation and initial development could yield some interesting information about how this is done.</p>
<p>ACH Transfers could be used with some (all?) facilities.</p>
